Unary operators in Java are operators that operate on a single operand.
They are used to perform various operations such as:
incrementing, decrementing, negating, or complementing a value.
Java supports several unary operators such as:

-Unary Plus (+) and Unary Minus (-)
-‘NOT’ Operator(!)
-Increment (++) and Decrement (--) Operators
-Bitwise Complement(~)
-
Unary Plus (+) and Unary Minus (-) Operators:
The unary plus operator (+) indicates positive value.
The unary minus operator (-) negates the value of its operand
int x = 10;
int y = -x;  // y = -10
int z = +x;  // z = 10
-
‘NOT’ Operator(!): The logical complement ('NOT') operator (!) is used to invert the value of a
boolean expression. If the operand is true, it returns false,
and if the operand is false, it returns true.
boolean isTrue = true;
boolean isFalse = !isTrue;  // isFalse = false
-
Increment (++) and Decrement (--) Operators:
The increment operator (++) increases the value of its operand by 1.
The decrement operator (--) decreases the value of its operand by 1.
These operators can be used as prefix (++x, --x) or postfix (x++, x--),
with the difference being when the increment or decrement operation is applied.
int x = 5;
int y = ++x; // y = 6, x = 6
int z = x--; // z = 6, x = 5
-
Bitwise Complement (~) Operator:
The bitwise complement operator (~) is used to invert all bits of its operand.
It's only applicable to integral types (int, long, short, char, byte).
int x = 5;  // binary representation: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
int y = ~x; // binary representation: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010

Example program in Java that implements all basic unary operators for user input:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class UnaryOperators {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		// System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
		// int num = sc.nextInt();
		int num = 10;

		int result = +num;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after unary plus is: "
			+ result);

		result = -num;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after unary minus is: "
			+ result);

		result = ++num;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after pre-increment is: "
			+ result);

		result = num++;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after post-increment is: "
			+ result);

		result = --num;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after pre-decrement is: "
			+ result);

		result = num--;
		System.out.println(
			"The value of result after post-decrement is: "
			+ result);
	}
}
