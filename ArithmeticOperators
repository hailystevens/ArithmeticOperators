Arithmetic operators in Java are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical
operands. Java supports several arithmetic operators:
+ = addition of two numbers
- = subtraction of two numbers
* = multiplication of two numbers
/ = division of two numbers
% = (Modulus Operator)Divides two numbers and returns the remainder
-
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
int sum = 5 + 3;  // sum = 8
-
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first operand.
int difference = 7 - 4;  // difference = 3
-
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
int product = 2 * 6;  // product = 12
-
Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second operand.
double quotient = 10.0 / 3.0;  // quotient = 3.3333333333333335
-
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand.
int remainder = 10 % 3;  // remainder = 1
-
Increment (++): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
Can be used as a prefix (++x) or postfix (x++).
int x = 5;
x++;  // x = 6
-
Decrement (--): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
Can be used as a prefix (--x) or postfix (x--).
int y = 8;
y--;  // y = 7
-
Here is an example program in Java that implements all basic arithmetic operators for user input:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperators {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
		double num1 = sc.nextDouble();

		System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
		double num2 = sc.nextDouble();

		double sum = num1 + num2;
		double difference = num1 - num2;
		double product = num1 * num2;
		double quotient = num1 / num2;

		System.out.println("The sum of the two numbers is: " + sum);
		System.out.println("The difference of the two numbers is: " + difference);
		System.out.println("The product of the two numbers is: " + product);
		System.out.println("The quotient of the two numbers is: " + quotient);
	}
}
Input: Enter the first number: 20
       Enter the second number: 10
Output: The sum of the two numbers is: 30.0
        The difference of the two numbers is: 10.0
        The product of the two numbers is: 200.0
        The quotient of the two numbers is: 2.0
