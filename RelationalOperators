Relational operators in Java are used to compare two values and determine the relationship
between them. They are often used in conditional statements and expressions to make decisions
based on the comparison result.

Java provides the following relational operators:

    Equal to (==): Checks if the values of two operands are equal.
If they are equal, the condition becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false.
    Not equal to (!=): Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.
If they are not equal, the condition becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false.
    Greater than (>): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of
the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false.
    Less than (<): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the
right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false.
    Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than
or equal to the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true; otherwise,
it becomes false.
    Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to
the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of relational operators:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
// Equal to
boolean isEqual = (x == y);   // false
// Not equal to
boolean isNotEqual = (x != y);  // true
// Greater than
boolean isGreater = (x > y);   // false
// Less than
boolean isLess = (x < y);      // true
// Greater than or equal to
boolean isGreaterOrEqual = (x >= y);  // false
// Less than or equal to
boolean isLessOrEqual = (x <= y);     // true
