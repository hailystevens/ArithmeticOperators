<h1 align="center">Java Operators</h1>

###

<h2 align="center">In Java, operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands (variables, constants, or expressions). Java supports a wide range of operators, which can be categorized into several groups:

Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and unary operations.Example: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Relational Operators: Compare two values and determine the relationship between them.Example: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: Perform logical operations on boolean values.Example: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
Bitwise Operators: Perform bitwise operations on integer types.Example: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), ~ (bitwise complement), << (left shift), >> (right shift), >>> (unsigned right shift)
Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand.Example: + (unary plus), - (unary minus), ++ (increment), -- (decrement), ! (logical NOT)
Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator): A shorthand for if-else statements.Example: condition ? expression1 : expression2
Type Cast Operator: Converts one data type to another.Example: (type) expression
Instanceof Operator: Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.Example: object instanceof Class</h2>
