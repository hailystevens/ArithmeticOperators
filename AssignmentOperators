Assignment operators in Java are used to assign values to variables.
They combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment operation.
Java supports several assignment operators:

Assignment (=)
Addition Assignment (+=)
Subtraction Assignment (-=)
Multiplication Assignment (*=)
Division Assignment (/=)
Modulus Assignment (%=)
-
Assignment (=): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 5;
-
Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the value of the right operand to the left operand
and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 5;
x += 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x + 3;
-
Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the value of the right operand from the left operand
and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 8;
x -= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x - 2;
-
Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the value of the left operand by the value of the
right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 4;
x *= 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x * 3;
-
Division Assignment (/=): Divides the value of the left operand by the value of the right
operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 12;
x /= 4;  // Equivalent to: x = x / 4;
-
Modulus Assignment (%=): Computes the modulus of the left operand with the value of the right
operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:
int x = 10;
x %= 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x % 3;
